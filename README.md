# ocean-node

WIP, may not compile.

## 1. Make sure to use nvm

```bash
nvm use
```

## 2. Install deps

```bash
npm i
```

## 3. Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## 4. Open terminal 1 and run a node

```bash
export HTTP_API_PORT=8000
export PRIVATE_KEY=0x.....
export RPCS="{ \"1\": \"https://rpc.eth.gateway.fm\", \"137\": \"https://polygon.meowrpc.com\", \"80001\": \"https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com\" }"
```

For downloading the file from IPFS or ARWEAVE, please export the following env variables;

```bash
export IPFS_GATEWAY='https://ipfs.io/'
export ARWEAVE_GATEWAY='https://arweave.net/'
```
Then start the node:

```bash
npm run start
```


## 4. Open a 2nd terminal and run another node

```bash
export HTTP_API_PORT=8001
export PRIVATE_KEY=0x.....
export RPCS="{ \"1\": \"https://rpc.eth.gateway.fm\", \"137\": \"https://polygon.meowrpc.com\", \"80001\": \"https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com\" }"
```

For downloading the file from IPFS or ARWEAVE, please export the following env variables;

```bash
export IPFS_GATEWAY=''
export ARWEAVE_GATEWAY=''
```
Then start the node:

```bash
npm run start
```

Now, you should see the nodes discovery/connecting/disconnecting

Load postman collection from docs and play

## Docker:

First, build the image:

```bash
docker build -t 'ocean-node:mybuild' .
```
Then run it:

```bash
docker run -e PRIVATE_KEY=0x123 ocean-node:mybuild
```

## Structure:
 - Everything hovers around components:
    -  database:   will have connection to typesense/es and will implement basic operations.   This is used by all other components
    -  indexer:  upcoming indexer feature
    -  provider: will have core provider functionality
    -  httpRoutes:  exposes http endpoints
    -  P2P:  has P2P functionality.  will have to extend handleBroadcasts and handleProtocolCommands, rest is pretty much done

## Environment Variables
  
  For advanced uses, various aspects of `ocean-node` can further be configured through [environment
variables](docs/environment-variables.md).

## Run tests

### Unit tests

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

### Integration tests:

First, in a seperate terminal,install barge, checkout `feature/nodes` branch and start it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge.git
cd barge
git checkout feature/nodes
./start_ocean.sh
```

Now, back in your nodes terminal, you can run the tests

```bash
npm run test:integration
```
