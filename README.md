# ocean-node

WIP, may not compile.

## Running Locally

### 1. Make sure to use nvm

```bash
nvm use
```

### 2. Install deps

```bash
npm i
```

### 3. Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### 4. Open terminal 1 and run a node

```bash
export HTTP_API_PORT=8000
export PRIVATE_KEY=0x.....
export RPCS="{ \"1\":{ \"rpc\":\"https://rpc.eth.gateway.fm\", \"chainId\": 1, \"network\": \"mainet\", \"chunkSize\": 100 }, \"137\": { \"rpc\": \"https://polygon.meowrpc.com\", \"chainId\": 137, \"network\": \"polygon\", \"chunkSize\": 100 }, \"80001\": { \"rpc\": \"https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com\", \"chainId\": 80001, \"network\": \"polygon-mumbai\", \"chunkSize\": 100 }}"
```

For downloading the file from IPFS or ARWEAVE, please export the following env variables;

```bash
export IPFS_GATEWAY='https://ipfs.io/'
export ARWEAVE_GATEWAY='https://arweave.net/'
```

Then start the node:

```bash
npm run start
```

### 4. Open a 2nd terminal and run another node

```bash
export HTTP_API_PORT=8001
export PRIVATE_KEY=0x.....
export RPCS="{ \"1\": \"https://rpc.eth.gateway.fm\", \"137\": \"https://polygon.meowrpc.com\", \"80001\": \"https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com\" }"
```

For downloading the file from IPFS or ARWEAVE, please export the following env variables;

```bash
export IPFS_GATEWAY=''
export ARWEAVE_GATEWAY=''
```

Then start the node:

```bash
npm run start
```

Now, you should see the nodes discovery/connecting/disconnecting

Load postman collection from docs and play

## Docker:

First, build the image:

```bash
docker build -t 'ocean-node:mybuild' .
```

Then run it:

```bash
docker run -e PRIVATE_KEY=0x123 ocean-node:mybuild
```

## Structure:

- Everything hovers around components:
  - database: will have connection to typesense/es and will implement basic operations. This is used by all other components
  - indexer: upcoming indexer feature
  - provider: will have core provider functionality
  - httpRoutes: exposes http endpoints
  - P2P: has P2P functionality. will have to extend handleBroadcasts and handleProtocolCommands, rest is pretty much done

## Environment Variables

For advanced uses, various aspects of `ocean-node` can further be configured through [environment
variables](docs/environment-variables.md).

## Run tests

### Unit tests

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

## Integration tests:

First, in a seperate terminal,install barge, checkout `feature/nodes` branch and start it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge.git
cd barge
git checkout feature/nodes
./start_ocean.sh
```

Now, back in your nodes terminal, you can run the tests

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

## Additional tests / helper scripts

There are a couple of helper scripts to help test additional functionality and components integration. These can be found under 'src/helpers/scripts'
To run them, do either:

```
npm run client
```

(Purpose: for downloadURL flow. It requires at least 2 nodes properly configured and running)

OR

```
npm run check-nonce
```

(Purpose: for checking nonce tracking flow. This last one requires DB up and running)

## Log Retrieval using HTTP

### Get Multiple Logs

HTTP GET /logs

This endpoint retrieves multiple log entries based on various query parameters. If query parameters are not provided, it defaults to the last 24 hours of logs and a maximum of 100 log entries. Please replace the `startTime`, `endTime` values with actual data as per your requirement when making requests.

**Query Parameters:**

- `startTime` (optional): The start time for logs retrieval in ISO 8601 format.
- `endTime` (optional): The end time for logs retrieval in ISO 8601 format.
- `maxLogs` (optional): The maximum number of log entries to retrieve.
- `moduleName` (optional): The module name to filter the logs.
- `level` (optional): The log level to filter the logs (e.g., "info", "error").

**Example Request:**

```http
GET /logs?startTime=2023-01-01T00:00:00Z&endTime=2023-01-02T00:00:00Z&maxLogs=50&moduleName=auth&level=info

```

**Example Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "timestamp": 1700569124922,
    "level": "info",
    "message": "User logged in successfully.",
    "moduleName": "HTTP"
  },
  {
    "timestamp": 1700569124922,
    "level": "info",
    "message": "Session refreshed.",
    "moduleName": "HTTP"
  }
  // More log entries...
]
```

If no logs are found for the given criteria, you will receive a `404 Not Found` response.

### Get a Single Log by ID

HTTP GET /log/:id

This endpoint retrieves a single log entry by its unique identifier.

**Path Parameters:**

- `id`: The unique identifier of the log entry.

Example Request:

```http
GET /log/123456789
```

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "level": "info",
  "message": "NEW Test log message 1700569124912",
  "timestamp": 1700569124922,
  "moduleName": "HTTP"
}
```

If the log with the given ID is not found, you will receive a `404 Not Found` response. For server errors, you will receive a `500 Internal Server Error` response.

## Log Retrieval Using Script

The logging system provides a convenient way to retrieve logs via a command-line script. The script is capable of fetching logs with various filters, such as start time, end time, maximum number of logs, module name, and log level.

**Usage**
You can call the script directly from your command line with optional parameters to filter the logs. The parameters are as follows:

- `API_URL`: The URL of the logs API endpoint. Defaults to http://localhost:8000.
- `START_TIME`: The start time for the logs you want to retrieve. Defaults to 24 hours before the current time.
- `END_TIME`: The end time for the logs you want to retrieve. Defaults to the current time.
- `MAX_LOGS`: The maximum number of logs to retrieve. Defaults to 100.
- `MODULE_NAME`: The specific module name to filter the logs. Optional.
- `LEVEL`: The specific log level to filter the logs. Optional.

**Example Without Parameters (Uses Defaults):**

```bash
npm run logs
```

**Example With Specific Parameters:**

```
npm run logs http://localhost:8000 "2023-11-01T00:00:00Z" "2023-11-30T23:59:59Z" 50 "http" "info"
```
